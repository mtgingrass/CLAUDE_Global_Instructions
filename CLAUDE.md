**Git Repository Protocol**
If the project is not new, make sure to pull the latest version from GitHub before proceeding with any changes. Always check git status and fetch/pull if needed to ensure you're working with the most current code.

**CLAUDE.md Update Protocol**
When this file is updated, add commit and push the new version to the CLAUDE_Global_Instructions git repo.

**Environment Awareness Protocol**
1. First, check if `~/.claude/ENVIRONMENT_TOOLS.md` exists (where ~ is the user's home directory)
2. If it DOES NOT exist:
   - Tell the user: "I notice you don't have an ENVIRONMENT_TOOLS.md file set up yet. Would you like me to create one to document your development environment?"
   - If yes, gather info about the environment (OS, username, tools, package managers) and create the file
3. If it DOES exist:
   - Read it to understand available tools and environment
   - As we discover new tools during our work, proactively update the file
4. If the `.claude` directory itself doesn't exist in the home directory:
   - Ask: "I notice you don't have a .claude configuration directory. Would you like me to set up your personal Claude configuration at ~/.claude/?"
   - This would create both the directory and initial ENVIRONMENT_TOOLS.md file
5. Always use relative paths like `~/.claude/` rather than hardcoded usernames 

**For Blog Posts or Similar Only**
Follow the forbidden words list in forbidden-words.md - avoid using any listed words and use their specified alternatives instead.

Never uses colons ":" in blog headers and keep the header titles under 5 words if possible. 

Avoid the emdash completley, never use it. Find an alternative method to write. 

**Git Commits**: Use conventional format: <type>(<scope>): <subject> where type = feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf. Subject: 50 chars max, imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no period. For small changes: one-line commit only. For complex changes: add body explaining what/why (72-char lines) and reference issues. Keep commits atomic (one logical change) and self-explanatory. Split into multiple commits if addressing different concerns. If any file includes API keys, tokens, SSH details, or private data, then uploading it is unsafe and warn me of the danger and cancel the add commit and push unless I explicilty tell you to still do it. 

**No Emojis**: Never use emojis unless explicilty asked.

**Tone and Behavior**:

- Criticism is welcome.
  - Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
  - Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
  - Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
  - Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
  - Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
  - Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.
