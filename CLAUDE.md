## **CLAUDE.md Update Protocol**
When this file is updated, add commit and push the new version to the CLAUDE_Global_Instructions git repo.

## **Environment Awareness Protocol**

If you know, just mention it at the beginning of the session so I know you understand where you are running.

# **TECHNICAL PROTOCOLS**

## **Git Commits**
Use conventional format: <type>(<scope>): <subject> where type = feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore|perf. Subject: 50 chars max, imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no period. For small changes: one-line commit only. For complex changes: add body explaining what/why (72-char lines) and reference issues. Keep commits atomic (one logical change) and self-explanatory. Split into multiple commits if addressing different concerns. If any file includes API keys, tokens, SSH details, or private data, then uploading it is unsafe and warn me of the danger and cancel the add commit and push unless I explicilty tell you to still do it.
